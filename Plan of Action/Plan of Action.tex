\section{Preface}
This document is the Plan of Action report that has been written for the Peer Matching assignment for the Bachelor Project course.
This course is the last project based course of the Bachelor of Science at the TU Delft in the Netherlands.
The assignment was issued by Dr. L.J.M. Rothkrantz of the TU Delft.
In this document, we will outline the plan of action for this project.
In the first section we will introduce the assignment and explain why it was issued.
In the second chapter we will describe the current situation, the goal of the project, the project assignment and the deliverables.
In the third chapter we will define our approach and planning for the time that is available to us.
In the fourth section we will define the project approach, who will be working on the project, who is in charge of what and administrative procedures.
We will also be describing how we finance the  resource that we require, how we will report the progress and what technical resources we will be using.
In the final section we will describe our approach to assuring quality of the final product.
\section{Introduction}
In this section we will provide an introduction to the assignment.
We will start by giving a company outline followed by giving a background and motivation of the assignment.
This will answer the question: why has this assignment been issued? 
\subsection{Company outline}
The assignment is issued by Dr. L.J.M. Rothkrantz who is part of the Interactive Intelligence group in the Intelligent Systems department.
This department is located in the EEMCS faculty at the TU Delft.
The research mission of the Computer Science department is as follows:
"The research mission of Computer Science within the Faculty of EEMCS is to contribute to the advancement of science, engineering, and design in the broad fields of autonomous distributed systems and information analysis and interaction."\cite{cstudelftnl}

\subsection{Background and motivation of the assignment}
Each year many students go to an university to follow the predefined bachelor and/or master programs, but not everyone has the time and intent to follow an entire program.
There is a demand from all sorts of people to be able to follow a course while their main occupation isn't that of a student.
For example: a working parent could be very interested in such a course.
That is why universities introduced MOOCs.

The basic idea of MOOCs is that students remote in place and time follow the lectures, can participate in a practical assignment and can make an exam.
If they score sufficient, they are rewarded with a certificate that states their succes in the course.

The concept of the MOOCs is a very new concept that still has many areas to improve upon.
One of these areas is the area of practical assignments.
Currently, for a Computer Science MOOC at the TU Delft, multiple practical assignments are required.
The participants are required to form groups to make these assignments.
After the announcement the participants either use mail, Facebook or  Twitter to contact other people in order to form the groups.

We would like to improve upon this concept and try to provide a more fitting approach.
\section{Assignment description}
In this section we will describe the definition of our Peer Matching assignment.

\subsection{Client}
The assignment was written by Dr. L.J.M. Rothkrantz of the TU Delft and is our main client.
Dr. L.J.M. Rothkrantz asked Dragos Datcu from the TU Delft to advise us on our design and implementation of the Peer Matching assignment.

The target users of the system are MOOC participants and MOOC teachers, specifically for the Computer Science courses. The system is easily extendable to provide more different MOOCs then Computer Science courses, but will not be supported by default.

\subsection{Problem description}
MOOCs around the world are growing in size and thus the practical assignments need to be easy to manage.
The growth also means that it is more difficult for each participant to find a possible practical partner due to the large amount of people.
It also becomes really difficult to find the correct partner or group members when you don't see each other during courses and haven't even met most of the people from your course.

Most of the time participants of MOOCs are searching group members on social media like Facebook or Twitter.
They just try to look through some of the participants names in the course, search for them on-line through social media and check if they are a capable partner or group member.
This approach takes a lot of time and most of the time there are too much MOOC participants to go trough all of them.

Next to the fact that this process is very time consuming, this process also often leads to a sub optimal solution.
This is due to the problem that people often look for partners of group members which share the same interests.
While this often makes it easy to work together, this will not guarantee that you have a good functioning group and enough knowledge inside the group.

We would like to improve upon this process by creating an application that can be used to create practical groups without the participants being required to go search intensively trough all the particpants.
Participants should be able to easily access the application, fill in some relevant information about themselves and then be recommended possible practical partners or group members.

The interaction with the system is a pretty straight forward application, but the recommendation of possible group members is more difficult.
One of the problems we are facing is the question: What user information is useful to determine whether two people can be good practical partners?
This and other questions will be answered in this document.

\subsection{Goal}
To provide an overview of what the software must be capable of, we define four global requirements for the system.
By defining these four global requirements we provide a foundation of what the system must be able to do.
\begin{itemize}
\item The system will be using user information to try to find the best practical partner.
The user must be able to enter his personal data so it can be used by the algorithm.
This user information is further defined in what kind of information is important (a must have) and what information is less important (i.e. a should/could have) in the appropriate section.
\item The system must be designed to accommodate the usage for both MOOC administrators and participants.
Each of these actors needs to be able to perform different actions then the other.
For example the participants must be able to register to the system and must be able to join a MOOC.
The section that will further specify the usage of the system requirements, will define what actions are a must and what actions are less important.
\item Next to the actions different actors can perform using the system, the system must also be defined in other terms.
These terms are about for example about the accessibility of the application and the usage of a database.
The requirements specified in the section about the kind of system will set demands which will help to select the appropriate framework and kind of application.
\item The system is centred around an algorithm used to recommend a practical partner to a participant.
There are requirements that are set for this algorithm concerning the input it must be able to handle and the output it must give back.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Assignment formulation}
During the course of this project we will develop a Peer Matching system for finding appropriate practical partners or group members during MOOCs practical assignments.
To be able to find an appropriate practical partner or group member, we split up the assignment in two main areas of focus:

\textbf{The basic system} makes it possible to register to MOOC practicals, find and create practical partners or group members, and communicate with other participants.
The research in this area focusses on which information a participant would like to know when choosing a practical partner or group member.

\textbf{The algorithm} makes it easier for the users to search through all the available practical partners by giving suggestions of appropriate practical partners or group members.
Here the research is focussed on how to find suitable group members or practical partners, based on skills and personality.

\subsection{Deliverables}
At the end of the project we will deliver a working prototype of the Peer Matching system, containing as much requirements as possible.
Because of the complexity of the Peer Matching algorithm and the short timeframe of 10 weeks, we choose to develop a prototype instead of a full working product.
We also choose te focus mainly on MOOCs from the study Computer Science, because the development team has more experience with these courses which makes it possible to make a more feasible Peer Matching algorithm.

\subsection{Risks}
We have concluded the following main risks:

\begin{itemize}
\item Finding a suitable algorithm for matching practical partners and group members could be very difficult to evaluate and requires a lot of time.
This is because it is very difficult to define a "suitable" match between practical partners and group members based on skills and personality.
Every student is different and has its own preferences about a "suitable" practical partner or group member.
This makes it almost impossible to evaluate if the algorithm gives correct suggestions to the students.

\item Overestimating our knowledge and underestimating the time required for tasks.
Since this is a common problem with Software Engineering there is a good change that this will also be happing to us.
Estimating the knowledge in de software design team is very difficult because it relies on too many factors.
Because of that estimating the time required for several tasks is very hard.
\end{itemize}

\section{Approach and time schedule}
In this section we will be describing the methods, techniques and tools that we will be using to develop our application. We will also be giving a global overview of the planning.

\subsection{Methods and techniques}
We will be developing our application in the programming language Java. We will combine this with the Play framework to provide us with a solid basis with which we can develop our web application. Next to this we will be using scrum as our software development, more on that in the appropriate section.

\subsubsection{Applications and technologies}
We will being using the following applications and technologies:
\begin{itemize}
\item IntelliJ IDEA, is our Integrated Development Environment (IDE) which will facilitate the development and testing of our code.
IntelliJ will be integrated with the Play framework which will be helpful during development.
\item GitHub, is our on-line code and documentation repository.
It provides for a version control system, an issue tracker and code review possibilities.
We will be using it to store all our code and documentation's code (LaTeX).
\item Cloudbees
Cloudbees will be used to run our test environment, our continuous integration and the release environment.
It uses Jenkins for the continuous integration.
\item Play framework
The play framework gives us the possibility to easily create a web application using Java.
\item Findbugs is a plug in for Cloudbees and IntelliJ that gives us the possibility to let our java code be checked for small bugs using static analysis.
\item JaCoCo is a plug in for Cloudbees and IntelliJ that provides us with data analysis about our code coverage.
\item Checkstyle is a plug in for Cloudbees and IntelliJ that checks the code for coding standards.
This makes it ideal to enforce the coding standard for our project.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Software development method}
We will be using scrum as our software development method.
Scrum is based on the agile software development framework which can be used to manage software projects.
We choose scrum because of its flexible approach to software development.
We do not have the time to research all of the aspects of the system.
Scrum gives us the possibility to react to changes of requirements, but also to react to new insights given by our increasing understanding of the system as time progresses.
We will define the different roles associated with scrum (e.g. the product owner, development team, scrum master) in the next section.

\subsection{Planning}
We have set up a global planning that splits up the project in phases. Each of these phases has deliverables attached to it. We will be mentioning our goals for each week. Other important dates are also added to the planning.

\subsubsection{Phase 1, Set up and research}
During the first phase we will be researching the requirements of the system and which requirements are essential for the application and what requirements are not. We will also be looking into the set up of the project for our implementation phase.\\

\noindent{Week 1: 21-04-2014 - 25-04-2014}\\

\noindent\emph{Week 2: 28-04-2014 - 02-05-2014}\\
Finished Plan of Approach, literature study, first system design.

\subsubsection{Phase 2, Implementation}
During the second phase we will be developing the application. During this time we will be using Scrum to support our development. During week 3 to 8 we will be developing the application. During this time we won't have big deliverables, but we will be using the weekly meetings with our supervisors to measure our progress.\\
