\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
During the past weeks we have created a platform where teachers can create the practicals associated with their MOOC and where students can enrol for practicals and form practical groups to work together on assignments.
This platform serves as a proof of concept for the various problems that were mentioned in the problem description.
One of the problems is the scale of MOOC's, which makes searching for a good group member is not a trivial problem.
To assist the student in forming a good group, the platform recommends possible group members to the searching student.

We split the project up in three phases: the orientation phase, the implementation phase and the final phase.
The project started off with the orientation phase in which the different aspects of the problem description were analysed.
During this time we looked into what kind of recommendation algorithm we will be using.
We also made an extensive list of requirements that helped us set out the different design decisions.
Lastly, we made a basic system design.
In the next phase, the implementation phase, we incrementally implemented the different features of the system.
At the end of the implementation phase we started the user tests.
With these user tests we tested the interface and basic usage of the system.
During the last phase we finished up the last features and we focused on documenting the project in this report.
We also received the feedback of SIG on the maintainability of our source code, one of the things done in the last phase was to improve the source code using this feedback.
The last thing to be done in the last phase is looking in what ways we can improve on the final product.
This is discussed in the future work section later this chapter.

%Uitleggen wat we in dit document hebben beschreven
This report documents the entire project.
We start with introducing the problem and our target audience.
Secondly, the report describes our supervisors, the different actors of the system, global goals, global requirements and detailed requirements.
Following this, we describe the project methodology we have chosen and we discuss how it panned out for us.
Per phase we describe the goal, planning and deliverables of the phase.
We also reflect on each phase separately.
In chapter 4 we describe the design we made of the system and how we implemented specific parts.
Things that we discuss in this chapter: Database diagram, class diagram, state diagrams, sequence diagrams, MVC, implementation of the recommendation algorithm and implementation of the invitation system.
Next, we describe the different kinds of testing that has been done during the project.
We start with describing the different kinds of testing that we have done during the implementation phase, followed by the testing that we have done after the implementation phase.
During the implementation phase we made use of unit testing and integration testing.
After the implementation phase we made use of a user test and requirements test.
Lastly, we describe the feedback that we have received from SIG and how we think to improve on this feedback.
