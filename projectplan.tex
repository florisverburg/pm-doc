\section{Project plan}
In this section we are going to discuss our plan for the project. 
We will discuss the project methodology and software development methodology,
as well as our planning and the tools that are used in the project.

\subsection{Project methodology}
We will work the entire project in a group of three at the TU Delft, instead of working at a company. 
Because we work with only a group of three in just a single room, we can communicate the whole time.
This kind of group work is very suitable for using Scrum, an agile software development process.

\subsection{Planning}

\subsection{Tools}
It is important to choose the right tools for our project.
